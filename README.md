A Speech Recognition System, also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is a software-based system designed to convert spoken language into written text. It captures voice input through a microphone, processes the audio signal, and uses algorithms to identify the words spoken. These systems are commonly used in applications such as voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant), transcription services, call centers, and accessibility tools.
